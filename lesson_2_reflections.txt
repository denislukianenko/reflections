When I initalize the repo git createa its .git folder, sets name for repo, description, creates settings files, folder structure representing hooks, refs, brunches

Staging areag gives us an opportunity to choose files to commit.

### How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
You may compare staging area to the repository with git diff --stage

### What are some situations 
when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Brenches can help with adding new features that not surely will be added to the project or just experimenting.

###How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
They just help to see the state of repo visually. Very useful. It's hard to hold big (if there is may branches) 
picture in your head. Also CLI visualization is Meh.

###What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
Mex I'm tired and bored.

###What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
Controooool.
